## Project info
Can a machine learning project be carried out to estimate the salary of baseball players whose salary information and career statistics for 1986 are shared?

## Dataset info

This dataset was originally taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. This is part of the data that was used in the 1988 ASA Graphics Section Poster Session. The salary data were originally from Sports Illustrated, April 20, 1987. The 1986 and career statistics were obtained from The 1987 Baseball Encyclopedia Update published by Collier Books, Macmillan Publishing Company, New York.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* PyCharm: 2021.3 
* Pandas: 1.3.4 (especially "corrwith")
* Scikit-learn

## Developments 
These are only v1 versions of the notebooks. After finding more patterns with better feature engineering, accuracy will be boosted. I'll constantly update notebooks as I work on them.
